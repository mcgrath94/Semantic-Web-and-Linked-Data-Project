# Semantic-Web-and-Linked-Data-Project
API Project

** by Niall McGrath **

#### Intro
This is an API I created which allows you to query 2 datasets about how many households own a car and how people travel to work/ school or college. I think this will show people that almost every household has a car and will show how different areas travel to work, college or school.

#### Datasets used
The first dataset I used is one which shows household cars and can be found here:  http://data.cso.ie/datasets/households-cars.html

The second deals with how people commute and can be found here:
http://data.cso.ie/datasets/population-commuting-means.html

#### How to Query the API
You can get a list of the number of people and how the commute by area: http://commuteapi.com/area/[area] where you replace [area] with the area. For example, the URL: http://commuteapi.com/area/Mayo will return a list of people from Mayo.

## Example use of the API
A person could use this to find out what areas people are more likely to have cars or how people commute. Somebody could then use this for example to see if there was an opportunity for a bus service in an area.



I will add more info as the project goes on
