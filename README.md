# Semantic-Web-and-Linked-Data-Project
API Project

** by Niall McGrath **

#### Intro
This is an API I created which allows you to query 2 datasets about how many households own a car and how people travel to work/ school or college.

#### Datasets used
The first dataset I used is one which shows household cars and can be found here:  http://data.cso.ie/datasets/households-cars.html

The second deals with how people commute and can be found here:
http://data.cso.ie/datasets/population-commuting-means.html

#### How to Query the API
You can get a list of the number of people and how the commute by area: http://commuteapi.com/area/[area] where you replace [area] with the area. For example, the URL: http://commuteapi.com/area/Mayo will return a list of people from Mayo.



I will add more info as the project goes on
